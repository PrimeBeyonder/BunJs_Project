# BunShop - RESTful API with Bun.js, Zod, Prisma, SQLite, and TypeScript

This is my first project using **Bun.js** while learning and exploring the Bun.js documentation. In this project, I am building a **RESTful API** with **Zod**, **Prisma**, **SQLite**, and **TypeScript**. The goal is to create a simple backend API to manage data, using these modern tools and frameworks for a fast and scalable development experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Bun.js**: A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime used for building the application.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema validation library used for input validation.
- **Prisma**: An ORM used for database access and management with SQLite as the database.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight SQL database used to store data.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making development more efficient and error-free.
